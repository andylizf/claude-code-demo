# CI/CD Example with Claude Code

## Real Research Workflow Example

### Scenario: Data Analysis Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Before committing your analysis code
git add analysis.py
git commit -m "Add new data processing"
# Claude automatically checks for:
# - Missing error handling
# - Performance issues  
# - Security vulnerabilities

# 2. On GitHub PR
# Automatically runs:
# - Full code review
# - Suggests improvements
# - Checks for common research code issues
```

### Benefits for Research

1. **Catch bugs early** - Before they affect your results
2. **Consistent code quality** - Every commit is reviewed
3. **Save time** - Automated checks run while you work on other things
4. **Documentation** - Auto-generate docs for your functions

### Quick Setup

```bash
# For any research project:
cp setup-ci.sh your-project/
cd your-project
./setup-ci.sh
# Done! Claude now guards your code quality
```
